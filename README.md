# MNIST Digit Recognition using TensorFlow

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for high accuracy in digit classification.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-digit-recognition.


jupyter notebook MNIST_Digit_Recognition.ipynb
```

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset comprises 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Model

The notebook details the CNN architecture used for digit classification, including layers, activation functions, and compilation strategy.

## Evaluation

Evaluation metrics are provided within the notebook to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the trained model on test data.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit pull requests to enhance the functionality or performance of the model.
